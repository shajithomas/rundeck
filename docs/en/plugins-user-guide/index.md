% Plugins User Guide
## Overview

Most of what Rundeck does is via one of its plugins. 
Several [plugin types](plugin-types.html) exist
to [execute commands on nodes](node-execution-plugins.html), 
perform a step in a workflow, 
send a notification about job status, gather
[information about the hosts](resource-model-source-plugins.html) 
in your network, copy a file to a remote
server, store and stream logs, or talk to a user directory.

See the [Plugin Developer Guide](../developer/index.html) if you are interested in creating one of your own plugins.
